## How to find appropriate standard metadata for datasets or samples?

### Description
There are multiple standards for different types of data, ranging from generic dataset descriptions (e.g. DCAT, Dublin core, (bio)schema.org) to specific data types (e.g. MIABIS for biosamples). Therefore, **how** to find a standard metadata, and **how** to find the appropriate repository for depositing your data become relevant questions.
 
### Considerations
* Decide at the beginning of the project what are the [recommended repositories](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases) for your data types.
  * Note that you can use several repositories if you have different data types.
  * Distinguish between generic (e.g. Zenodo) and data type (technique) specific repositories (EBI repositories).
 
### Solutions
* If you have a repository in mind:
  * Go to the repository website and check the “help”, "guide" or “how to submit” tab to find information about required metadata.
  * On the repository website, go through the submission process (try to submit some dummy data) to identify metadata requirements. For instance, if you consider publishing your transcriptomic data in ArrayExpress, you can make your metadata spreadsheet by using [Annotare 2.0 submission tool](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/annotare/), at the beginning of the project.
  * Be aware that data type specific repositories usually have check-lists for metadata. For example, the European Nucleotide Archive provides [sample checklists](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists) that can also be [downloaded as a spreadsheet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/sample-checklist).
 
* If you don’t know yet what repository you will use, look for what is the recommended minimal information (i.e. “Minimum Information ...your topic”, e.g. [MIAME](http://fged.org/projects/miame/) or [MINSEQE](http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/) or [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org)) required for your type of data in your community, or other metadata, at the following resources:
  * [RDA](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/).
  * [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org) at “Standards” and “Collections”.
  * [DCC](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/list).
