## What is Data Sharing?
Data Sharing means making datasets known and available to the global research community and to society at large. Data sharing can be done at any time during the research data life cycle but, at the latest, data should be made available at the time of publication of articles that use the data to make scientific conclusions. 

## Why is Data Sharing important?
Sharing of data is a cornerstone of good science. It is ethical good research  practice to ensure that data underlying research is preserved and made available to the research community and society at large. Sharing data is a necessary prerequisite for making your research reproducible. To be useful for others, you should strive to make the shared data adhere to the [FAIR principles](). 

In the EU, the 'Open Data Directive' ([Directive (EU) 2019/1024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024)) states that "_Member States shall support the availability of research data by adopting national policies and relevant actions aiming at making publicly funded research data openly available (‘open access policies’), following the principle of ‘open by default’ and compatible with the FAIR principles._"

Many research funders, institutions and reputable journals/publishers now have data sharing mandates, from which you normally cannot opt out of unless there are legitimate reasons. 

* Additional reasons to share your datasets:
  - [Ten reasons to share your data.](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/ten-reasons-to-share-your-data)
  - [Ask not what you can do for open data; ask what open data can do for you.](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2017/06/19/ask-not-what-you-can-do-for-open-data-ask-what-open-data-can-do-for-you/)

Even though it may not be possible to openly share all data because of ethical, legal, contractual, or intellectual property reasons, do strive to make data "_as open as possible, as closed as necessary_".

## What should be considered for Data Sharing?

* Take Data Sharing into consideration already at the [Planning stage](planning). Don't leave it to the last stage. 
* Making the data as FAIR as possible will ensure that the most value can be made out of it in the future.
  - The easiest way to make data FAIR is to deposit it in a publicly accessible recognised repository.
  - If there are Dicipline-specific repositories available for you data, this should be your primary choice. They will work towards a high level of FAIRness by recommending appropriate community standards for describing the data. 
    - Some recommendations for _Discipline-specific repositories_:
      - For Biomolecular Data in Life Science use one of the [ELIXIR Deposition Databases](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases), or use the [EBI Guidance Wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)
      - [Repositories recommended by Nature publishing group](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
      - [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)
      - [Re3data](https://re3data.org/)
  - In case there are no suitable Dicipline-specific repositories for your data, your choices are:
    - Deposit the data in an _Institutional repository_, if there is one. These often provide stewardship and curation, helping to ensure that your dataset is preserved and accessible. Contact the the Research Data Office function at your institution, if there is one.
    - Deposit the data in a [_General purpose repository_](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#general).
* Consider depositing your data to a repository as early as possible. This saves a lot of trouble later on. Data can be put under embargo until you want to release it, e.g. at the time of article publication.
* To make your life easier, structure the metadata according to your target repositories early on in the project (see Planning).
* Note that all data might not be possible to make publicly available because of ethical, legal, contractual, or intellectual property reasons. 
  - For some types of data, there are repositories that can harbour data that will be under controlled access.
    - For the sharing of human-subject phenotype/genotype data there are well-established repositories ([EGA](https://ega-archive.org/), [dbGAP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), [JGA](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/jga/index-e.html)). 
      - The choice will depend on the conditions under which data has been donated and the legislative/geographic boundaries for the research project/consortium. 
    - There are also community-specific data hubs that may implement a controlled-access model e.g. ORPHANET, MJFF.
  - If there isn't any suitable repository that can harbour your controlled access data, it is recommended that you at least create a metadata record for the data in an Institutional or General purpose repository.
